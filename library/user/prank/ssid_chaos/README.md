## What This Is

SSID Chaos Engine is a themed SSID broadcast generator designed to weaponize curiosity, paranoia, humor, and confusion—purely at the name level. It doesn’t crack, sniff, or attack. It **pollutes the airspace with personality**.

Think of it as environmental storytelling for Wi-Fi scans.

Every theme is a curated swarm of SSIDs, rotated and blasted out as a cohesive “scene.” Neighbors scan.

## Themes

Each mode is a self-contained identity broadcast, not a random list.

* **Passive Aggressive Neighbor**
  Domestic surveillance energy. HOA-grade menace.

* **Confused Technology**
  Eternal loading bars and systems that almost work.

* **Maximum Dad Jokes**
  Groan-powered RF emissions.

* **1337 H4X0R Mode**
  Federal agencies, honeypots, and 90s terminal energy.

* **Maximum Paranoia**
  Sleeper agents, countdowns, and implied inevitability.

* **Spooky / Horror**
  The router was never empty.

* **Gamer Mode**
  Respawn points, lag accusations, and boss-level Wi-Fi.

* **Cinematic Universe**
  One network to rule them all.

Each theme is logged, repeatable, and capped cleanly within SSID length limits.

## Behavior

* SSIDs are truncated safely to spec
* Broadcast history is logged
* Pools are cleared before injection
* Themes are mutually exclusive
* Start, stop, and purge are deliberate actions
